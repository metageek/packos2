* Replace Makefiles with bazel.  Current Makefiles do not have any
  cross-directory dependencies, which is leading to occasional
  glitches.

 * Bleah--bazel does not have support for building 32-bit, statically
   linked binaries with no stdlibs in sight.  Shocking.  I'll have to
   solve the problem some other way.

* Add proccess switching to kernel, with memory protection.  OK if it
  initially requires manually yielding.

* Add a timer to the kernel, which triggers a process switch.
